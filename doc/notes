R package:

R inference package

Ideas:
  * biased coin
  * t tests
  * 2 sets of data from different distributions
  * 3 - 5 data points
  a) 3 biological replicates -> 10 biological replicates w/ 2 distribution t test
  b) Coin/die or on the fly of RNGs
  c) test linear against not linear
  d) MCMC GLM see what examples they use
  e) Repressilator

Plot joint distributions?
Marginals

1) 
inputs:
data, prior, likelihood function (data, model, parameters), we get back samples from posterior and evidence
sequence of heads

2) 
t test
